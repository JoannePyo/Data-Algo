# 12. Radix Sort (stable sort)

* Perform Counting Sort, digit by digit
* Commonly from least significant digit (right) to most significant digit (left)
* Requires a “stable sort” so that we don’t lose effect of sort on earlier digits
* “Digit” doesn’t necessarily mean a number 0-9
  * Can be a digit in another base (base 100, hexadecimal)
  * Can be a character A-Z (base 26) or ASCII (base 128 / 256)
