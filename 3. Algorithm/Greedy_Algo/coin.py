Find minimum number of coins that make a given value

Coin Change
Given an integer array of coins[ ] of size "N" representing different types of 
denominations and an integer "sum", the task is to find the number of ways 
to make "sum" by using different denominations.
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin.

Input: sum = 4, coins[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four solutions: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 3}.
