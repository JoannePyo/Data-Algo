a **binary search tree (BST)** is a binary tree.

The key **difference** is that a BST only allows you to **store nodes with lesser value on the left side** and **nodes with greater value on the right.**

* Directed tree with root on top
* Each node has at most two children
* Key (and usually data) stored in node
* Keys less than the key of a node are in the left subtree (LST)
* Keys greater than the key of a node are in the right subtree (RST)
* Height of the tree
  * can be computed recursively as 1 + max(height(LST), height(RST))
  * Height of tree with one node is 0
  * at most n-1
* Also can speak of the depth of any given node
